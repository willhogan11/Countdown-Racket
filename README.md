# Summary

Countdown is a popular TV program, where a contestant is given a list of numbers and a target number. 
The object of the game is for the contestant to reach the target number using basic operators and any combination of the original list. 
I'm using the functional programming language _Racket_ to emulate the game. 

The game isn't fully finished and so this project has been more about trying to understand how Functional Programming works as a whole, 
which i feel is part of the learning process linked to this module. 

For more detailed information about this project, go to the **wiki** pages in this repository.
